AmazonSolo is built for people who want to visit the Amazon, but feel:
- intimidated  
- unsure which country to choose  
- worried about scams and safety  
- overwhelmed by logistics  
- uncertain how to do it ethically  

AmazonSolo becomes:
> **the calm confidence bridge.**

- safety-first  
- humility-first  
- ethics-first

- nature immersion

## ⚠️ Reality Check (Non-Negotiable)

Solo travel in the Amazon has real risks:

- illness  
- isolation  
- river transport complexity  
- scams in gateway towns  
- weather volatility  

AmazonSolo must include:

This honesty is what makes the site respected.

---

Tone:

- competent  
- grounded
